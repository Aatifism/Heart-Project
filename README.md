 ******HEART PROJECT******


The Heart project, developed in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), is designed to monitor vital signs and detect arrhythmias in real time. A PPG sensor collects data related to heart activity, and this data is displayed on a web interface featuring a 3D model of the human heart, providing users with a clear, visual representation of their heart's condition.

A crucial part of this project is the integration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify ECG signals. By processing the data gathered from the PPG sensor, the system predicts the likelihood of a heart attack, allowing for early detection and preventive healthcare.

In addition to its advanced analytics, the project incorporates a LoRa (Long Range) transmitter, which enables the transmission of data over long distances without the need for an internet connection. LoRa technology is highly efficient for sending small amounts of data over kilometers, making it ideal for remote monitoring in areas with limited internet connectivity. This feature ensures that critical health data can still be transmitted to healthcare providers or monitoring systems, even in remote locations, making the solution accessible in a wider range of scenarios.

By combining real-time monitoring, machine learning for predictive analysis, and LoRa technology for long-range data transmission, the Virtual Heart project offers a robust solution for early diagnosis and better health management, particularly in areas lacking reliable internet infrastructure.
